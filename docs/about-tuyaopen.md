This open-source framework for AIoT development, built on the proven TuyaOS IoT system, delivers cross-platform architecture, component-based design, and enterprise-grade security validated by 100M+ global devices. Its on-device AI inference engine with cloud-edge multimodal AI capabilities enables developers to access compliant Chinese LLMs (DeepSeek/Qwen/Doubao) or integrate global AI services (ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini) through unified API toolkits for text/voice interactions and image/video generation.

Supporting mainstream open-source ecosystems, it allows seamless porting across chipsets/development boards, accelerating prototyping to production-ready deployment within 72 hours via Tuya's certified hardware partners.
