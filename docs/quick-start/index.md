## Terms and definitions

â€ŒBefore starting with TuyaOpen, please familiarize yourself with the following key terms:

### TuyaOpen dedicated license

The **license** is an encryption certificate issued by Tuya to allow a device to connect to the Tuya IoT operating system. Each device must be assigned a unique license for authentication. A license grants permission for a single device to connect to and access the cloud.

The **license** consists of a `UUID` and an `AuthKey`.

The TuyaOpen dedicated license applies to all TuyaOpen Framework components, including:

- [TuyaOpen for C](https://github.com/tuya/TuyaOpen)
- [TuyaOpen for Arduino](https://github.com/tuya/arduino-TuyaOpen)
- [TuyaOpen for LuaNode](https://github.com/tuya/luanode-TuyaOpen)

:::danger
TuyaOpen Framework requires the use of a TuyaOpen dedicated license. Licenses from other sources (including TuyaOS licenses) cannot be used within the TuyaOpen Framework to connect to the Tuya IoT Cloud.
:::

#### UUID

A universally unique identifier (UUID) is a unique number generated by various algorithms to identify each device. A UUID is a 20-character string and does not change with operations such as repeated activations and pairing.

#### AuthKey

AuthKey is the device authentication key issued by the platform. As a 32-character string, the AuthKey has a one-to-one mapping to the UUID, and it is strongly bound with the PID and UUID. Note: This parameter is very important and will be used during device authentication. Keep the value safe.

### PID

PID stands for the product ID. Each product created on the platform is assigned a unique PID. Each PID is associated with the details of a specific product, including the data points (DPs), app control panel, and purchase information. A PID can be regarded as the identity card of the associated product.

:::info
Typically, the PID, UUID, and AuthKey are referred to as the device triplet.
:::

### Device ID

A device ID is assigned by the cloud each time the device is activated and paired. It is associated with the actual user device data linked to the account and app after successful pairing. The device ID can change in certain specific scenarios, and will be reassigned after re-pairing and reactivation. For example, on the app, go to the device panel and tap the top right corner to access the device properties page, then tap **Unbind and Clear Data**.


## Get TuyaOpen license

- Method 1: Go to the [Production](https://platform.tuya.com/purchase/index?type=6) page and purchase a module that is flashed with a TuyaOpen license. This license is permanently written into the module during manufacturing and cannot be lost. TuyaOpen automatically reads the license via the `tuya_iot_license_read()` interface during startup. Verify whether your purchased modules already contain TuyaOpen licenses.

- Method 2: If your module does not have a pre-flashed license:
   - You can purchase TuyaOpen licenses on the [Production](https://platform.tuya.com/purchase/index?type=6) page.
   - Alternatively, you can purchase TuyaOpen licenses on the [Purchase](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=911596682625&spm=a21dvs.23580594.0.0.621e2c1bzX1OIP) page.

## Preparations

Before getting started, make the following preparations:

- Get [TuyaOpen licenses](#Get-TuyaOpen-license).
- Get [Tuya's universal serial tool](https://www.tuyaopen.ai/tools/tyutool) for firmware flashing, TuyaOpen license writing, serial debugging, and subsequent operations.
