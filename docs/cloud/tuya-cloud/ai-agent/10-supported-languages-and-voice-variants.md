title: Supported Languages and Voice Variants

# **Supported Languages and Voice Variants**

This topic describes the languages and voice variants supported by AI agents.

# **ASR and TTS**

The implementation of AI chat functionality relies on two core technologies: automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text to speech (TTS).

Simply put, ASR converts user speech into text, while TTS transforms the agent’s responses into audible speech. The agent achieves true voice interaction (**hearing and speaking** capability) only when both technologies support the target language.

Currently, the AI Agent Dev Platform supports ASR and TTS for multiple languages across various countries and regions, enabling users to interact with agents naturally in their native languages. For instance, in China, the system already supports Mandarin, English, Cantonese, and certain regional dialects (such as Sichuanese and Henanese). For the world market, the system currently supports major languages, including English, Spanish, Japanese, and French.

It is recommended to prioritize the **supported languages** listed in the table below to ensure seamless voice input and output for users. For currently unsupported languages, please await future system updates.
