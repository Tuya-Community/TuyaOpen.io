# **Agent OpenAPIs**

# **Overview**

Agent OpenAPIs enable third-party integration of Tuya-powered AI agents. Suppose you have developed an AI agent on the Tuya Developer Platform and want to integrate it with your own platform or software products. In that case, you can access the agent’s data through Tuya’s OpenAPI endpoints.

The open capabilities of the agents on the platform are continuously being improved. You can refer to the platform documentation for the latest updates.

# **Usage**

Access to the OpenAPIs is managed on the Tuya Developer Platform. You need to create a cloud project on the [Cloud Development](https://platform.tuya.com/cloud) section of the platform and subscribe to the relevant services to make API calls. The agent’s APIs use access keys issued by the cloud project for authentication.

# **Billing**

No functional fees are charged currently.

However, the agent tokens consumed during API calls are subject to standard metering and billing. For more information about billing rules, see [Agent Metering and Billing](https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/iot/ai-agent-price?id=Kegb2s2shaj4d#title-3-Model%20fees).
