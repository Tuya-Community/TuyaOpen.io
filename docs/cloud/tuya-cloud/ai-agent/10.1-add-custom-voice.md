# **Add Custom Voice**

# **Overview**

This document introduces how to add custom voices for your AI agent. Please complete the following steps:

- Step 1: [Copyright or Originality Proof of Voice Source](https://developer.tuya.com/cn/docs/iot/ai-agent-customsounds?id=Kf6gftgfduuqt#claim).
- Step 2: [Sign Non-Infringement Commitment Letter](https://developer.tuya.com/cn/docs/iot/ai-agent-customsounds?id=Kf6gftgfduuqt#commit).
- Step 3: [Submit the Above Materials and Voice Files for Replication](https://developer.tuya.com/cn/docs/iot/ai-agent-customsounds?id=Kf6gftgfduuqt#submit).

# **Copyright or Originality Proof of Voice Source**

Please choose one of the following methods to provide copyright or originality proof:

### Method 1: Local Copyright Registration of Voice IP

For developers who hold the copyright themselves, copyright registration is required in the region where the voice work was created or sold. Since copyright registration takes a long time, you can submit application proof materials to Tuya (such as screenshots of the application website or acceptance notices), and the certificate can be submitted later.

### Method 2: Complete Voice IP Authorization Chain

For developers who do not hold the copyright themselves, the following documents are required:

- Provide the authorization contract from the original voice copyright owner to the developer, [see reference attachment for details](https://drive.weixin.qq.com/s?k=AGQAugfWAAkXX4rKLm). If there are other sub-licensing situations in between, complete authorization proof for each segment must be provided.
- Register and log in to the [Intellectual Property Protection Platform](https://ipr.tsa.cn/time/ApplyTime), as shown in the figure below, upload the voice file and recording proof materials, and obtain the original timestamp certificate.
