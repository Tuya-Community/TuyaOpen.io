Remind me to charge you based on your role description.Response reference: I am running out of power, only `{{sys.dp}}` left. Please recharge me quickly. ⚠️ Only output the reminder content, and do not make any other response. | My battery is running low. If you don’t charge me now, I will shut down soon. Do you want me to disappear forever? Please give me some energy! |
