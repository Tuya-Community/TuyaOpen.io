# Dynamic Light Effect DIDI Glasses

## Project Overview

Create immersive entertainment with heartbeat and rhythm becoming visible light. Music beats flow through the frame. This project demonstrates TuyaOpen's ability to transform abstract emotions into tangible visual experiences, showcasing how the framework enables developers to create innovative social interaction devices with minimal technical barriers.

In modern social scenarios, non-verbal communication has become an important way of emotional expression. We designed a cool light effect glasses suitable for various social occasions, such as parties and gatherings, to enhance the efficiency of emotional transmission between people through colors and dynamic light effects. TuyaOpen's Tuya T5AI Board development platform provides the perfect foundation for rapid prototyping and deployment of such creative AI-powered wearable devices.
