# TuyaOpen With RDK-X5

## Project Overview

Running TuyaOpen multi-modal agent with powerful local AI powerhouse RDK X5 SBC. This project represents the pinnacle of TuyaOpen's vision for democratizing AI development, showcasing how the framework enables developers to create sophisticated edge computing solutions that leverage the RDK X5's integrated NPU for true local AI processing combined with cloud intelligence.

Seamlessly integrate IoT and Cloud multi-modal capabilities with local NPU AI processing for edge computing applications. This project demonstrates how to leverage the RDK X5's ARM-based architecture and integrated NPU to run TuyaOpen's intelligent agents with true local processing power while maintaining seamless cloud connectivity. TuyaOpen's "end-side AI + cloud service + ecosystem synergy" approach makes it possible to build truly intelligent systems that operate efficiently at the edge with local NPU acceleration while staying connected to the broader AI ecosystem.
