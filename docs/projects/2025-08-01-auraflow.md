# Auraflow

## Project Overview

An intelligent companion tomato timer robot designed for users who easily fall into deep focus, helping them rest scientifically through personalized intervention mechanisms. This project exemplifies TuyaOpen's vision of making AI accessible to everyone, demonstrating how the framework enables developers to create sophisticated AI-powered devices that understand and respond to human behavior patterns.

The system supports two trigger modes: 1) Timed reminders based on preset duration (user customizable); 2) Active intervention when focus decline is detected in real-time (such as delivering drinks), guiding rest in a non-intrusive way. TuyaOpen's multi-modal AI capabilities make it possible to integrate brain-computer interfaces, computer vision, and robotic control into a seamless, intelligent system that adapts to individual user needs.
