# Soccer Star

## Project Overview

A spherical robot that looks exactly like a soccer ball. It can run independently and walk to the opposite goal. This project demonstrates TuyaOpen's ability to enable creative and entertaining AI applications, showcasing how the framework makes it possible for developers to build fun, innovative devices that combine robotics with AI intelligence.

When it appears on the field, the era of Chinese soccer has arrived. It can run into the opponent's goal, and Chinese soccer achieves victory. TuyaOpen's comprehensive development platform enables rapid prototyping of such creative projects, making it easy for developers to bring their imaginative ideas to life with minimal technical barriers.
