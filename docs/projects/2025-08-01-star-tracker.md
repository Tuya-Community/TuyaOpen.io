# Star Tracker

## Project Overview

A new-style compass based on Tuya T5AI-CORE development board with T5-E1 chip module, capable of pointing to stars and implementing astronomical Agent dialogue. This project showcases TuyaOpen's cloud-based AI agent capabilities by integrating the Tuya developer platform's agent framework with astronomical expert prompts, demonstrating how TuyaOpen makes AI development accessible to hardware creators through cloud connectivity.

We reinvented the compass using the TUYA T5-E1 development board, displaying the compass on a 4LineSPI TFT display, calibrating the orientation of the MPU6050 gyroscope, and rotating based on the gyroscope's directional angle to achieve basic compass functionality. The TuyaOpen framework enables seamless integration of cloud-based AI agents with hardware sensors, making complex astronomical calculations and real-time celestial body identification possible through cloud processing.
