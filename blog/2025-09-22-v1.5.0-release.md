## 🎉 v1.5.0 Major Release (September 22, 2025) - We've Been Working Hard! This Update, We Really Went All Out!


After months of careful refinement by the team, v1.5.0 is finally here! This update can be said to be our most comprehensive upgrade recently, from the underlying architecture to user experience, every detail has been infused with the team's dedication. We also thank the active community and developers who gave us many great suggestions to make the TuyaOpen project more fun and richer. The team is also particularly happy to see community developer [HangYongmao](https://github.com/HangYongmao) join the open-source co-creation and create some fun game demos.

### 💪 T5AI Platform: Performance Leap, Hardware Ecosystem Explosion

# Tuya Platform Integrates MCP!
Tuya Intelligent Agent Development Platform now fully supports MCP Server integration capabilities. By integrating official MCP Servers or custom-developed MCP Servers, the interaction capabilities between intelligent agents and third-party services and IoT devices can be significantly expanded. This is equivalent to equipping large language models with "eyes, arms, and legs" to perceive and execute in the physical world, making them no longer limited to text conversations, but achieving intelligent decision-making through LLM, establishing efficient and secure interactions with real-world devices and services, truly building an intelligent bridge between AI and physical systems.
Tuya's MCP Technology Advantages
- Designed for IoT Device Ecosystem: Tuya ecosystem devices are plug-and-play, just add MCP Server to the intelligent agent, and devices can be used immediately, seamlessly integrated into various IoT scenarios.
- Support Diverse MCP Service Integration: In addition to official preset MCP Servers, it also supports developer custom extensions of MCP services, combining rich service ecosystem with personalized integration.
- Simpler Development Integration: Just register the service once on the platform and integrate a lightweight SDK to quickly achieve multi-region access and deployment of MCP Servers.
- Global Service Deployment Support: Covers service connections in five major regions worldwide, supports low-latency access nearby, meeting business deployment and compliance needs in different regions.
- Secure and Reliable Long Connection Communication: Establishes secure long connections in multiple regions based on WebSocket protocol, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data transmission

### 🛠️ MCP SDK Quick Integration Entry
Developers can quickly integrate MCP capabilities through the official open-source SDK, greatly simplifying the development process.  
- **MCP SDK (Open Source) Address**: [https://github.com/tuya/tuya-mcp-sdk](https://github.com/tuya/tuya-mcp-sdk)
This SDK provides complete integration [documentation](https://developer.tuya.com/cn/docs/iot/mcp-manage?id=Ketxzvb2s9ziq), example code, and continuous maintenance, supporting multi-platform and multi-language extensions, helping developers efficiently achieve seamless connection between intelligent agents and the physical world.


# TuyaOpen SMP Architecture! What is SMP Architecture? How Does It Improve Performance?
![AMP vs SMP](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQIGZ1BIgEvkdELaNGGX_P2SoDTFdHkpTPPiA&s)
  
AMP (Asymmetric Multi-Processing) and SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing) are two common architectures for multi-core processors:

- **AMP (Asymmetric Multi-Processing)**: Each core can run different operating systems or tasks, resource allocation and scheduling between cores are relatively independent, suitable for scenarios with special requirements for real-time or security. For example, one core runs Linux, another core runs RTOS, they don't interfere with each other, but development and resource management complexity is higher.

- **SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing)**: All cores run the same operating system, the system automatically distributes tasks to each core, cores have equal status and share resources. Developers don't need to care about which core specific tasks execute on, development experience is simpler, suitable for high concurrency and multi-task scenarios.

**In short**: AMP is more flexible but complex, suitable for special needs; SMP is easier to use, suitable for most general multi-core applications. T5AI v1.5.0 adopts SMP architecture, making multi-core development simpler and more efficient!

**What Does TuyaOpen's SMP Architecture Mean for Developers? Do You Need to Change Your Development Approach?**
> Summary: v1.5.0 makes development more efficient and powerful, but your development habits and code structure basically don't need major changes, just focus on new features and multi-core best practices to easily enjoy upgrade benefits!

- **Smoother Development Experience**: SMP multi-core support and hardware ecosystem expansion allow you to easily develop high-concurrency, multi-task applications without worrying about performance bottlenecks. Original single-core code doesn't need major modifications, the system will automatically schedule multi-core resources, but if you want to further tap multi-core potential, you can achieve higher performance through multi-threading/multi-task programming (such as RTOS tasks, LVGL multi-threaded rendering, etc.).
- **API Compatibility Guarantee**: Most APIs are compatible with older versions, existing projects can upgrade smoothly. New hardware and new driver access methods are consistent with before.
- **More Creative Space**: LVGL dual versions, rich peripherals and game applications allow you to try more innovative approaches. You can directly reuse official examples, or develop your own applications based on new drivers and new capabilities.
- **No Major Refactoring Needed**: If you already have projects based on T5AI, you don't need large-scale code refactoring after upgrading to v1.5.0.
- **Recommendation**: To fully utilize multi-core and new hardware capabilities, it is recommended to learn and use RTOS tasks, semaphores, queues, and other multi-core concurrent programming methods, refer to official multi-core examples and documentation.
